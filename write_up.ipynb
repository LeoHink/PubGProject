    "## The homophily and social contagion of cheating\n",
    "\n",
    "The final assignment asks you to use the computational thinking and programming skills you learned in the course to answer an empirical social science question. You are expected to apply the best practices and theoretical concepts we covered in the course to produce a program that not only returns the correct output but is also legible, modular, and reasonably optimized. The assignment assumes mastery of loops, conditionals, and functions, as well as awareness of issues related to runtime performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assignment, we will study the homophily and social contagion of cheating in the massive multiplayer online game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). Cheating in this context means the adoption of unapproved software that gives the player an unfair advantage in the game (e.g. being able to see through walls). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypotheses are that cheaters tend to associate with other cheaters but also, players who interact with cheaters become likely to adopt cheating themselves. To provide preliminary evidence for these hypotheses, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe whether cheaters tend to team up with other cheaters more than chance.\n",
    "2. Observe whether players who observe cheaters are likely to become cheaters more than chance.\n",
    "3. Observe whether players who are killed by cheaters are likely to become cheaters more than chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the \"more than chance\" part, we will simulate alternative universes in which the players played the same game but joined a different team or happened to be killed by someone else at a different time. We will then compare how what we observe in the actual data compares to what we would expect in a \"randomized\" world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: You are only allowed to use fundamental Python data types (lists, tuples, dictionaries, numpy.ndarray, etc.) to complete this assignment.** You are not allowed to use advanced data querying and data analysis packages such as pandas, sqlite, networkx, or similar. We impose this restriction in order to test your grasp of fundamental programming concepts, not your scripting experience with Python libraries from before or from other courses you may be taking. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this assignment is quite streamlined, imagine that the tasks here are part of a larger project. How would you structure your program if in the future you may need to use a different dataset with similar structure, manipulate the data differently, add additional analyses, or modify the focus of the current analysis?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep different data manipulations in separate functions/methods and group related functions/classes in separate `.py` files. Name your modules in an informative way."

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find the data in the repository [https://github.com/lse-my470/assignment-final-data.git](https://github.com/lse-my470/assignment-final-data.git). Please clone the data repository in the same directory where you clone the repository `assignment-final-yourgithubname`. Keep the name for the data folder `assignment-final-data`. Any time when you refer to the data in your code, please use a relative path such as `'../assignment-final-data/filename.txt'` instead of an absolute path such as `'/Users/myname/Documents/my470/assignment-final-data/filename.txt'`. This way, we will be able to test your submission with our own copy of the data without having to modify your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data were collected by Jinny Kim (LSE MSc ASDS '19). The repository contains the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cheaters.txt` – contains cheaters who played between March 1 and March 10, 2019\n",
    "    1. player account id\n",
    "    2. estimated date when the player started cheating\n",
    "    3. date when the player's account was banned due to cheating\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `kills.txt` – contains the killings done in 6,000 randomly selected matches played between March 1 and March 10, 2019\n",
    "    1. match id \n",
    "    2. account id of the killer\n",
    "    3. account id of the player who got killed\n",
    "    4. time when the kill happened\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* `team_ids.txt` – contains the team ids for players in 5,419 team-play matches in the same period. If a match from the kills.txt file does not appear in these data, we will assume that it was in single-player mode.  \n",
    "    1. match id \n",
    "    2. player account id\n",
    "    3. team id in match\n",
    "    \n",
    "You should not modify the original data in any way. Similarly, you should not duplicate the data in this repository but instead use a relative path to access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks ask you to output actual counts and expecteded counts (mean with 95% confidence interval). To estimate the 95% conifdence intervals, ignore the small sample size and the fact that we are dealing with count data, and simply use the approximation: 95% CI $= \\mu \\pm 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ the standard deviation of the counts in the $n=20$ randomizations. You are free to use `statsmodels` or `numpy` to calculate these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing your code, test it on a small \"toy dataset\", instead of the entire data. This way, you won't need to wait for minutes/hours just to find out that you have a syntax error!\n",
    "\n",
    "If the randomization is time consuming, it may be worth finding a way to save the data you generate on hard disk so that you don't need to run the randomization again and again. If you decide to do so, please write your code to save any such files with processed data in the directory where this file resides. This way, we can run your code without having to alter it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to save any new data, think carefully about the most efficient way, both in terms of time and space, to save them."
