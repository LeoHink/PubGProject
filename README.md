# PubGProject
Project exploring patterns of cheating and social networks in PubG. Coursework for a masters level computer programming course. 
Purpose is to demonstrate my python programming. 

Note as the data set is not publicly availibe this code cannot be reproduced on your local machine. 

`observation.py` contains the code used to calculate number of cheater and whether cheating propogates through social networks through players observing other players cheating. 

`simulation.py` contains the code where the dataset is randomly permuated in order to compare observed rates of cheating with random cases of cheating.
